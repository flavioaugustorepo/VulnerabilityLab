# Vulnerability Management on Nessus

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This project covers <b>vulnerability scanning and remediation.</b> I will be using <b>Nessus Essentials</b> to scan a local hosted on the VMWare Workstation in order to run credentialated scans to discover existing vulnerabilities, remediate some of them, then perform a rescan to verify remediation.</p>

<h2>Utilies used</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Nessus</li>
  <li>PowerShell</li>
  <li>Windows Firewall</li>
  <li>VMWare</li>
</ul>

<h2>Connecting Nessus to the Virtual Machine</h2>
<p>In order to connect the VM to Nessus, we need to find our IP adress first. By running <code>ipconfig</code> on the Command Prompt, we can access information regarding the local network. By using <code>ping</code> followed by the IPv4 address from the local machine, we can verify that a <q>Request timed out</q> message appears. In order to enable connection to the VM, we will turn off the Windows Firewall for all profiles as shown bellow.</p>

<h2>Creating and rumming a remote manual scan</h2>
<p>For this project, we will create and run a basic manual network scan through Nessus' dashboard by providing our VM's IPv4 address as a target by selecting <q>Basic Network Scan</q> after <q>New Scan</q>.</p>
<p>After running the first scan, we can verify that a few medium severity vulnerabilities have been discovered, while most are information alerts</p>

<h2>Running credentialed scans</h2>
<p>In order to run credentialed scans, we will enable <q>Remote Registry</q> on <q>Services</q>, turn <q>User Account Control</q> off, add a <q>LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy</q> file and set its value to 1 through the registry editor. Additionally, we will install a deprecated version of Firefox to verify if it triggers any vulnerability warning on the Nessus dashboard.</p>

<p>On the Nessus' dashboard, we will now add the VM's credentials through the <q>Credentials</q> tab, save our changes and rescan our system.</p>

<p>We can see how the number and severity of the vulnerabilities found are now significantly higher. In addition to a missing .NET update, the dashboard also points to a deprecated version of Mozilla Firefox as well as other issues on the machine.</p>

<h2>Remediating vulnerabilities</h2>

<p>After taking into account the missing updates and deprecated software installed on our machine, it's crucial to remediate as many vulnerabilities as possible. Having critical or high impact vulnerabilities might compromise the safety of systems, assets and information stored in our machine.</p>
<p>After enabling Windows Update, installing the available patches and removing Firefox 3 from our VM, we will rescan our system to check any possible vulnerabilities that might still be present.</p>

<p>As shown, the number and impact of vulnerabilities found are now significantly lower. This is a direct result of the corrective steps recommended by Nessus.</p>
