# Vulnerability Management on Nessus

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This project covers <b>vulnerability scanning and remediation.</b> I will be using <b>Nessus Essentials</b> to scan a local machine hosted on the VMWare Workstation to discover existing vulnerabilities, remediate them, and then perform a rescan to verify remediation. I will be doing both credentialed and non-credentialed scans.</p>

<h2>Utilities used</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Nessus Essentials</li>
  <li>PowerShell</li>
  <li>Windows Firewall</li>
  <li>VMWare</li>
</ul>

<h2>Connecting Nessus to the Virtual Machine</h2>
<p> To connect the VM to Nessus, we need to find our IP address first. By running <code>ipconfig</code> on the Command Prompt, we can access information regarding the local network. By using <code>ping</code> followed by the IPv4 address from the local machine, we can verify that a <q>Request timed out</q> message appears. To enable connection to the VM, we will turn off the Windows Firewall for all profiles, as shown below.</p>

<h2>Creating and running a remote manual scan</h2>
<p>For this project, we will create and run a basic manual network scan through Nessus' dashboard by providing our VM's IPv4 address as a target by selecting <q>Basic Network Scan</q> after <q>New Scan</q>.</p>
<p>After running the first scan, we can verify that a few medium-severity vulnerabilities have been discovered, while most are information alerts</p>

<h2>Running credentialed scans</h2>
<p> To run credentialed scans, we will enable <q>Remote Registry</q> on <q>Services</q>, turn <q>User Account Control</q> off, add a <q>LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy</q> file and set its value to 1 through the registry editor. Additionally, we will install a deprecated version of Firefox to verify if it triggers any vulnerability warning on the Nessus dashboard.</p>

<p>On the Nessus' dashboard, we will now add the VM's credentials through the <q>Credentials</q> tab, save our changes and rescan our system.</p>

<p>We can see how the number and severity of the vulnerabilities found are currently significantly higher. In addition to a missing .NET update, the dashboard also points to a deprecated version of Mozilla Firefox as well as other issues on the machine related to vulnerabilities found on additional programs, namely Microsoft Office.</p>

<h2>Remediating vulnerabilities</h2>

<p>After considering the missing updates and deprecated software installed on our machine, it's crucial to remediate as many vulnerabilities as possible. Having critical or high-impact vulnerabilities might compromise the safety of systems, assets and information stored in our machines.</p>
<p>After enabling Windows Update, installing the available patches and removing Firefox 3 from our VM, we will rescan our system to check any possible vulnerabilities that might still be present.</p>

<p>As shown, the number and impact of vulnerabilities found are now significantly lower. This is a direct result of the corrective steps recommended by Nessus.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>For this project, I set up a local machine through VMWare, changed its security settings and performed several vulnerability scans through Nessus Essentials. When deprecated software and missing updates were detected, the number and severity of alerts were significantly higher. After this, I installed available updates and removed deprecated software to verify if the number of vulnerabilities had changed. After remediation, the number and impact of the found vulnerabilities were significantly lower.</p>
